Refactored the IntlManager class to separate public and internal APIs:
- Created a public IntlManager class that exposes only the necessary methods and properties
- Moved internal implementation details to InternalIntlManager
- Updated type definitions to reflect the new structure
- Improved documentation in README.md with more examples and API details
