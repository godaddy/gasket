# Governance

## Levels of Involvement

### Contributor

Anyone who contributes to Gasket, through pull requests, responses to issues,
documentation or otherwise, is a contributor.

### Maintainer

Maintainers have commit permissions. They are responsible for creating release
commits.

## Consensus-seeking

Different levels of consensus are needed for different kinds of changes. For
small PRs, it is sufficient to get the two approvals you need to merge the PR.

For major design additions or refactors, it is more important to get buy-in
from other contributors before starting. Post in the [Slack] channel, and allow
a few days for other contributors to weigh in. Your goal here is to 1) get
feedback on your plan before investing the time in a PR and 2) to get buy-in from
other contributors. Once you have addressed blocking feedback and received some
buy-in, you are ready to proceed with code changes.

## Working Groups

We anticipate the creation of working groups to give direction and define best
practices for major
Gasket feature areas. Here are a few ideas for future working groups:

* Front-end frameworks: e.g. Nextjs, Svelte
* Feature areas: e.g. Intl, lint
