# Releases

Gasket uses [Semantic Versioning]: "major.minor.patch", where major
version changes indicate incompatible changes, minor versions indicate
added functionality that is backwards compatible, and patch changes
do not change the API.

To create a release, please open a release PR that bumps the version number of
any impacted modules as dictated by [Semantic Versioning]. In the PR description,
please enumerate the changes included in the release. Post about the release in
[Slack], and allow for two approvers before merging.
