            <h2>What is Gasket?</h2>
            <p>Gasket helps teams and communities compose frameworks to deliver apps of various shapes and sizes. While
                scaffolding is
                important, Gasket offers functionality beyond simple boilerplate generation. Gasket also provides the essential
                elements for libraries and layers of apps to integrate together during runtime.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <h3>CLI loads configured Presets & Plugins</h3>
            <p>The entry point to creating and interacting with apps. The CLI provides the frame and engine upon which apps are
                built.</p>
            <h3>Presets provide Plugins</h3>
            <p>Logical groups of plugins to build apps. Tech choices for teams, integrations for communities. Effectively, the
                framework you want to build apps within.</p>
            <h3>Plugins add Commands & Hooks</h3>
            <p>The building blocks of an app framework - plugins provide the scaffolding and circuitry to integrate libraries and
                have
                them communicate together.</p>
            <h3>Commands execute Lifecycles</h3>
            <p>Build and start your app. Analyze it, or read the docs. Just a few commands you can execute with available plugins,
                or
                create your own.</p>
            <h3>Lifecycles handled by Hooks</h3>
            <p>The nervous system to transmit signals between parts of apps. Not your typical events; lifecycles can be handled in
                order and executed in sync.</p>
            <h3>Hooks execute additional Lifecycles</h3>
            <p>Receptors to handle lifecycle events and perform the actual work of integrating libraries and implementing
                application
                code.</p>
