# Testing Gasket Plugins and Presets Locally

When modifying plugins or presets, you may want to test your changes locally before merging to the main branch. This guide describes how you can test your plugin or preset changes on your local machine.

## Testing preset changes locally

To test a preset locally, you can create a new Gasket app using `create-gasket-app` and utilize the `--preset-path` flag to specify the absolute path of the local preset you intend to test.

```sh
npx create-gasket-app test-app --preset-path=/absolute/path/gasket/packages/gasket-preset-example
```

This command will create a new Gasket app using your local preset. You can then test your changes by running the app and verifying that your changes work as expected.

## Testing local preset changes with installed plugins

Another way to test a preset locally, but with plugins installed from npm,
is to use the `--presets` flag while specifying the [local paths].

```sh
npx create-gasket-app test-app --presets=gasket-preset-example@file:/absolute/path/gasket/packages/gasket-preset-example
```

## Testing plugin changes locally

Two options for testing your plugin locally are to point a local app's dependencies a the local plugin or to use `npm link`.

### Point dependencies to local plugin

To test a Gasket plugin locally, you can modify the plugin dependency in a local Gasket appâ€™s `package.json` to point to the absolute path of the local plugin you want to test. After updating the path, run `npm install` to refresh the `node_modules` directory with the local version.

```diff
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-    "@gasket/plugin-example": "^1.0.0"
+    "@gasket/plugin-example": "file:/absolute/path/to/gasket/packages/gasket-plugin-example"
  }
}
```

### Use npm link

To test a plugin locally, you can link your plugin to your app using the `npm link` command. This will create a symbolic link between your plugin and your app, allowing you to test your plugin locally.

```sh
cd path/to/gasket/packages/gasket-plugin-example
npm link

cd path/to/app
npm link @gasket/plugin-example
```

## Gotchas for testing presets locally

When testing a preset locally, you might encounter an issue where the local version of a plugin in your preset isn't being used. This occurs because the preset specifies a specific version of the plugin. To resolve this, modify the plugin, as described in the [Testing plugin changes locally] section, to point to the local version instead of the version specified by the preset.
