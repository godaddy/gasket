# Package Management Guide

At any time during app development you can add new plugins, packages and/or 
dependencies. These packages can provide new features to your Gasket application
and/or change the way your application builds or is configured.

## Installing dependencies

For example if you want to install an additional plugin you can run either of the 
following commands. Make sure to replace `<plugin-name>` with the actual name of 
the plugin. Optionally, you can provide a version through `[@version]`, otherwise 
`latest` is installed by default. In the examples the scope of the plugin is `@gasket`.
Similarly this could be your own scope or the package might have no scope at all. 
Generic modules like `react` or `webpack` are good examples of this.

```bash
npm install @gasket/<plugin-name>[@version]
```

OR

```bash
yarn add @gasket/<plugin-name>[@version]
```

If your package/module will only be used during `development`. For example if you 
need `stylus` CSS support and want to include `@zeit/next-stylus` you should add it
as a devDependency. Adding `-D` will make `yarn` or `npm` add the dependency to 
`devDependencies`. Alternatively, `-P` and `-O` are available for `peer` or `optional`
dependencies. See the [npm][npm install] or [yarn][yarn install] install documentation
for more details.

```bash
npm install -D <package>
```

OR

```bash
yarn add -D <package>
```

### Symlinking modules

If you're creating a generic plugin for reuse in your team's projects, you can 
symlink it into your application's `node_modules` directory during development. 
Run one of the following commands from the plugin/package directory.

```bash
npm link
yarn link
```

Change to your Gasket application directory and run one of the following commands. 
This will symlink the module from above. Make sure to change `<@your-scope/package-plugin>`
to the `name` of your above module in its `package.json`.

```bash
npm link <@your-scope/package-plugin>
yarn link <@your-scope/package-plugin>
```

Note: If you're creating a plugin that is specific to a single project you're better
of creating a module in the `plugins` folder, see [the special plugin directory][plugin-directory]. 
Also creating a symlink will not automatically add it to the `package.json` dependency definitions.
