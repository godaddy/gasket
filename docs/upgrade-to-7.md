## Update Dependency Versions

Update all `@gasket` scoped packages to the v7 major version.

This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a sampling of dependencies to
demonstrate what to look for:

```diff
"dependencies": {
-    "@gasket/fetch": "^6.0.2",
+    "@gasket/fetch": "^7.0.0",
-    "@gasket/data": "^6.5.0",
+    "@gasket/data": "^7.0.0",
-    "@gasket/plugin-workbox": "^6.4.1",
+    "@gasket/plugin-workbox": "^7.0.0",
}
```

## Switch to makeGasket

Gasket no longer comes with a CLI.
Instead, you can use the `makeGasket` function from `@gasket/core` to create a
Gasket instance which can be used throughout your app.

```diff
"dependencies": {
-    "@gasket/cli": "^6.0.2",
+    "@gasket/core": "^7.0.0",
}
```

Next you need to update your gasket.config.js file to use the `makeGasket` function.
We recommend renaming this file to `gasket.js` for clarity, since it's more than
just config.

### Switch to ESM (Optional)

Gasket works well with ESM if you're ready to make that move.
Most of the documentation will be in ESM format, but you can still choose to
use CommonJS, or TypeScript.

If you wish to make that move with this upgrade, you can set the `type` field in
your `package.json` to `module`.

```diff
{
+  "type": "module"
}
```

This will treat all your `.js` files as ESM files.
If you are not ready, you can keep your files defaulted as CommonJS, and
switch individual files to ESM by using the `.mjs` extension (i.e. `gasket.mjs`)

### Update Plugin Imports

Before, plugins were configured by their names as strings.
Now, plugins should be imported and configured in the `makeGasket` function.

```diff
// gasket.config.js
- module.exports = {
-   plugins: {
-     presets: [
-       '@gasket/plugin-nextjs',
-     ],
-   },
- };

// gasket.js
+ import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
+ import pluginNextjs from '@gasket/plugin-nextjs';

+ export default makeGasket({
+   plugins: [
+     pluginNextjs
+   ]
+ });
```

### Update Command Scripts

If your app used GasketCommands such as `docs`, `analyze`, or other custom ones,
you can still invoke them by executing the `gasket.js`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-    "docs": "gasket docs",
+    "docs": "node ./gasket.js docs",
```

### Update Next Scripts

Additionally, you can use framework CLIs or other to run your Gasket-enabled
app.

For Next.js webapps, update your package.json scripts to use the Next CLI:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-    "build": "gasket build",
+    "build": "next build",
```

The prior version of Gasket used a custom server with Next.js. You can now use
the built-in server with Next.js, however to simplify the upgrade process, you
can continue with a custom server.

First, add a server.js file to your project root:

```js
import gasket from './gasket.js';
gasket.actions.startServer();
```

Notice we are importing our new `gasket.js` file and accessing a GasketAction
(more on that later).

Next, update your package.json scripts to use our new custom server entry:

```diff
"scripts": {
-  "local": "gasket local",
+  "local": "GASKET_DEV=1 nodemon server.js",
-  "start": "gasket start",
+  "start": "node server.js",
```

> You don't have to use nodemon, but it's a good choice for development.
> Also note that specifying `GASKET_DEV=1` will enable the development mode
> so you get HMR and other development features from Next.js.

If you were using CLI flags for setting the environment, since there is no CLI
you can use environment variables instead.

```diff
"scripts": {
-  "start:local": "gasket start --env=local",
+  "start:local": "GASKET_ENV=local node server.js",
```

The default environment will be `local`, but be sure to update your CICD scripts
with the environment variable pattern if flags are currently being used.

## Switch to GasketActions

Using the `req` and `res` objects for adding attachments and accessing data has
been a common pattern in Gasket applications. This pattern is being deprecated
in favor of using the new GasketActions API introduced in v7.

### Motivation

Middleware in Gasket apps runs for every request, regardless of whether it is
used or not. We added support for [middleware paths] to help reduce this,
but it is still not ideal and requires the developer to manage something that
should be optimized already by the plugin.

As a caveat of the middleware pattern, when the `req` and `res` objects are
decorated with various added properties, it is not always easy to know what is
available and when.

In addition to issues with middleware, we need to move away from reliance on
`req` and `res` objects to fully utilize Nextjs 14 features such as
[App Router] and [streaming].

The GasketActions API provides a more structured way to access and modify data
in Gasket applications. This API is designed to be more consistent and easier
to use than the previous pattern of adding attachments to `req` and `res` objects.

The `req` object can be used as a GasketAction argument to give access to
headers, cookies, queries, or to be used as a `WeakMap` key for repeated calls.

### Example

When retrieving a request-based variable called `myValue` in middleware,
you might have done something like this:

```js
const myValue = res.locals.myValue;
```

Going forward, the recommended way to access `myValue` would be through a
GasketAction like this:

```js
const myValue = gasket.actions.getMyValue(req);
```

GasketActions are registered by plugins. To create a new GasketAction, you can
use the `actions` key in your plugin definition.

```js
// plugin-example.js

export default({
  name: 'plugin-example',
  actions: {
    async getMyValue(gasket, req) {
      // Returns myValue
      // Use the req argument to access headers, cookies, queries, etc.
    }
  }
})
```

## Update configurations

**[@gasket/plugin-workbox]**

- Remove deprecated `assetPrefix` config support. Use `basePath` instead.

**[@gasket/plugin-nextjs]**

- Remove deprecated `next` config support. Use `nextConfig` instead.

**[@gasket/plugin-intl]**

- Remove deprecated `languageMap`, `defaultLanguage`, and `assetPrefix`.
  Use `localeMap`, `defaultLocale`, and `basePath` instead.

**[@gasket/plugin-webpack]**

- Remove deprecated lifecycles.
- Remove `webpackMerge` util.

**[@gasket/plugin-elastic-apm]**

- Remove deprecated `serverUrl`, `secretToken` config support.
- Do not start in preboot, log warning if not started.

**[@gasket/utils]**

- Remove deprecated function `applyEnvironmentOverrides`.

## Switch to Docusaurus

We no longer support `docsify` as a plugin for viewing local Gasket docs.
Instead, use [@gasket/plugin-docusaurus] for local documentation.

```js
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';

import pluginDocs from '@gasket/plugin-docs';
import pluginDocusaurus from '@gasket/plugin-docusaurus';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
    pluginDocs,
    pluginDocusaurus
  ]
});
```

## Update Lifecycles Contexts

We had some lifecycles that did not conform to the context object pattern we
have in place for many other lifecycles.

The reason for utilizing this context object is to enable the execution of these
lifecycle methods under two distinct scenarios:

1. During build time, when there is no request object available.
2. During run time, when the request object becomes available.

Affected lifecycles:

- `initReduxState`
- `nextPreHandling` `.d.ts` type file

If your app or plugins hooks these lifecycles you may need to adjust them.

```diff
- async initReduxState(gasket, config, req, res) {
+ async initReduxState(gasket, config, { req, res }) {
```

## Update ElasticAPM Start

With the Gasket CLI going away, we need to update how we start the ElasticAPM
agent.
We recommend using the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable to import
(or require) a setup script.

```diff
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "gasket start --require elastic-apm-node/start",
+   "start": "NODE_OPTIONS=--import=./setup.js next start",
  }
```

See [@gasket/plugin-elastic-apm] for more details about the setup script.

## Switch to GasketData

We have had a lot of confusion around the config plugin and its purpose.
As such, we are renaming and refocusing what the plugin does,
which is to allow environment-specific data to be accessible for requests,
with public data available with responses.

Instead of the generic 'config' name, we will term this 'gasketData' which pairs
well with the `@gasket/data` package - which is what makes this data accessible
in browser code.

Existing apps will need to update their Gasket config to use the new plugin name.

```js
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
import pluginData from '@gasket/plugin-data';
import gasketData from './gasket-data.js';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
    pluginData
  ],
  gasketData
});
```

If you have an `app.config.js` you will want to change the name to `gasket-data.js`

```diff
- <app-root-dir>/app.config.js
+ <app-root-dir>/gasket-data.js
```

Individual environment files are no longer supported out of the box.
You can still use this structure by importing environment-specific to the
`gasket-data.js` file and exporting them as environment properties.

```js
// gasket-data.js
import dev from './config/dev.js';
import test from './config/test.js';
import prod from './config/prod.js';

export default {
  environments: {
    dev,
    test,
    prod
  }
};
```

Additionally, we are dropping the `redux` property, aligning on `public`.

```diff
// gasket-data.js
export default {
  environments: {
    dev: {
-     redux: {
+     public: {
        someUrl: 'https://your-dev-service-endpoint.com'
      }
    },
    test: {
-     redux: {
+     public: {
        someUrl: 'https://your-test-service-endpoint.com'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you add lifecycle hooks for modifying the config data before, 
you will need to update the hook name to `gasketData` and adjust the signature.

- `appEnvConfig` -> `gasketData`
- `appRequestConfig` -> `publicGasketData`

See the [@gasket/plugin-data] docs for more details.

## Switch Redux to GasketData

If you are using the [@gasket/plugin-redux] to surface
config-like data to the browser, we recommend switch to GasketData, using the
[@gasket/plugin-data] plugin with [@gasket/data] instead.
The GasketData approach is leaner and works with the Next.js App Router and
Page Router using its built-in server.

`@gasket/plugin-redux` is not supported for Next.js built-in server apps. 

If you have other reasons to stick with Redux, you can still use it
Next.js Page Router using a custom server. However,
you will need to change the store property from `config` -> `gasketData`,
corresponding with the other guidance in the [Switch to GasketData] section.

## Switch to @gasket/plugin-logger

Gasket's logging infrastructure was comprised of two main parts:

1. `@gasket/plugin-log`: Manages lifecycle timing and executes the `logTransports`
   hook for adding extra transports to the logger configuration.
2. `@gasket/log`: Implements logging using Diagnostics (Client-side) and Winston (Server-side).

While these components worked together to initialize `gasket.logger`, not all
applications utilized them. Additionally, despite Winston's prevalence, we need
to be aware of the numerous logging libraries in the ecosystem when adopting Gasket.
The following updates aim to address these concerns:

Updates:
- Removed `@gasket/log`
- Created new [@gasket/plugin-logger] to replace `@gasket/plugin-log`
- Created new [@gasket/plugin-winston] to customize the default logger
- Added a per-request logger with updatable metadata
- Updated presets to use the winston logger

To upgrade your app, first adjust the dependencies in your `package.json`.

```diff
"dependencies": {
-  "@gasket/plugin-log": "^6.0.2",
-  "@gasket/log": "^6.0.2",
+  "@gasket/plugin-logger": "^7.0.0",
+  "@gasket/plugin-winston": "^7.0.0",
```

Next, update your `gasket.js` file to use the new plugins.
This examples demonstrates how to migrate from an old `gasket.config.js`.

```diff
// gasket.config.js
- module.exports = {
-   plugins: {
-     presets: [
-       '@gasket/plugin-log',
-     ],
-   },
- };

// gasket.js
+ import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
+ import pluginLogger from '@gasket/plugin-logger';
+ import pluginWinston from '@gasket/plugin-winston';

+ export default makeGasket({
+   plugins: [
+     pluginLogger,
+     pluginWinston
+   ]
+ });
```

Existing Gasket apps will need to make changes to how they handle logging.
Logging levels now follow `console` conventions.
Loggers at minimum support the following levels:

- `debug`
- `error`
- `info`
- `warn`

```diff
// gasket.logger.warning changes
- gasket.logger.warning
+ gasket.logger.warn

// logger.log changes
- logger.log
+ logger.info
```

The lifecycle method formerly known as `logTransports` is now `winstonTransports`.

```diff
- // /lifecycles/log-transports.js
+ // /lifecycles/winston-transports.js
```

See the [@gasket/plugin-logger] docs for more details, as well as the
[@gasket/plugin-winston] docs for customizing the logger.

## Update Intl

### Bring your Own Intl Provider

The [@gasket/react-intl] package is convenience wrapper for connecting
[@gasket/plugin-intl] features to a Next.js/React app, and which and had a hard
dependency on the `react-intl` package.

In our new version, users have more flexibility to choose their own intl provider.
While `react-intl` is still a good choice, it is no longer a hard dependency.
Another change is instead of magic webpack and process.env setups for importing
a generated manifest of translations, an explicit import of a generated `intl.js`
file necessary.

```diff
// pages/_app.js
- import { withIntlProvider } from '@gasket/react-intl';
+ import { withMessagesProvider } from '@gasket/react-intl';
+ import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
+ import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';
+ import intlManager from '../path/to/intl.js';

- const App = props => <div>{props.children}</div>
- export default withIntlProvider()(App);

+ const IntlMessagesProvider = withMessagesProvider(intlManager)(IntlProvider);
+ export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
+   const router = useRouter();
+   return (
+     <IntlMessagesProvider locale={router.locale}>
+       <Component {...pageProps} />
+     </IntlMessagesProvider>
+   );
+ }
```

The above example shows how to use the `withMessagesProvider` HOC to wrap the
`IntlProvider` from `react-intl`, however, note that it can now be swapped out
with another other provider now.

See [@gasket/react-intl] for more details and other changes.

### Switch to Intl Manager

As pointed out in the previous section, the `intlManager` is a new concept that
is required to be passed to the `withMessagesProvider` HOC. This manager is
responsible for loading and managing the translations for the app.

Locale files that are registered as statics are loaded at app startup and are
available for SSR.
Other locale files can be loaded on-demand in the browser.
No longer is `getInitialProps` or other Next.js props methods required.

As such, some of the component options have changed, and we adjusted some naming
for clarification.

```diff
- import { withLocaleRequired } from '@gasket/react-intl';
+ import { withLocaleFileRequired } from '@gasket/react-intl';
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

const PageComponent = props => <h1><FormattedMessage id='welcome'/></h1>

- export default withLocaleRequired('/locales/extra', { initialProps: true })(Component);
+ export default withLocaleFileRequired('/locales/extra')(Component);
```

The [@gasket/intl] package should be added as an app dependency.

```shell
npm install @gasket/intl
```

The new `intlManager` pattern enables locale files
to be bundled as Webpack chunks.
As such, it is no longer necessary to store these under the public directory of
a Next.js or serve then with an Express endpoint.
The locale files can exist anywhere, though a top-level `/locales` directory is
recommended as a convention.

See [@gasket/plugin-intl] for more details and other changes.

## Update Custom Commands

Update custom commands to be plugin imports in `gasket.js`.
All commands need to be imported and used in the `makeGasket` function.

To create a custom command, you first need to install [@gasket/plugin-command].

```
npm i @gasket/plugin-command
```

Once installed, import and add it to your list of plugins in `gasket.js`.

```diff
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
+ import pluginCommand from '@gasket/plugin-command';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
+    pluginCommand
  ]
});
```

Custom commands can be defined in line in the list of plugins.

```diff
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
import pluginCommand from '@gasket/plugin-command';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
    pluginCommand,
+    {
+      name: 'my-custom-plugin',
+      hooks: {
+        commands(gasket) {
+          return {
+            id: 'my-custom-cmd',
+            description: 'Custom command plugin',
+            args: [],
+            action: async () => {
+            }
+          }
+        }
+      }
+    }
  ]
});
```

Another option for defining custom commands is to create a separate file.

```js
// my-custom-plugin.js
export default  {
  name: 'my-custom-plugin',
  hooks: {
    commands(gasket) {
      return {
        id: 'my-custom-cmd',
        description: 'Custom command plugin',
        args: [
          {
            name: 'arg1',
            description: 'Message to display',
            required: true // error if arg1 argument is not provided
          },
          {
            name: 'arg2',
            description: 'Optional message to display'
          }
        ],
        // Arguments are spread into the action function
        action: async (arg1, arg2) => {
          console.log('custom arg:', arg1);
          console.log('custom arg 2:', arg2);
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Once this custom command is defined, import the file and use it in the
`makeGasket` function.

```diff
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
import pluginCommand from '@gasket/plugin-command';
import customPluginCommand from './my-custom-plugin.js`;

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
    pluginNextjs,
+    customPluginCommand
  ]
});
```

It can now be executed by `node` with the `gasket.js` file.

```bash
node ./gasket.js my-custom-cmd "Hello, World!"
# result: custom arg: Hello, World!

# Optional message
node ./gasket.js my-custom-cmd "Hello, World!" "Optional message"
# result: custom arg: Hello, World!
# result: custom arg 2: Optional message
```

See the [@gasket/plugin-command] docs for more details.

## Update App Plugins

Previously, custom plugins defined in the `/plugins` directory did not require
any additional configuration.
This is no longer supported in `v7`.
Instead, all plugins will need to be explicitly imported to `gasket.js`.

For example, if the plugins folder of your application looks something like the following:
```
/pages
/plugins
  custom-plugin.js
  second-custom-plugin.js
gasket.js
```

The two plugins will be imported to `gasket.js` and added to the list of plugins in `makeGasket`.

```diff
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
+ import customPlugin from './plugins/custom-plugin.js';
+ import secondCustomPlugin from './plugins/second-custom-plugin.js';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
+    customPlugin,
+    secondCustomPlugin
  ],
  filename: import.meta.filename,
});
```

## Update App Lifecycles

Support for lifecycle magic directories has also been removed in `v7`.
Now lifecycles need to be defined and hooked in a plugin.
One way of doing this is to create a new plugin, import the lifecycles as hooks,
and then import the plugin to `gasket.js`.

```js
// /lifecycles/[lifecycle].js
export function lifecycleHook(gasket) {
  gasket.logger.info('Created lifecycle: ', lifecycle);
};
```

```diff
// /plugins/lifecycles-plugin.js
+ import lifecycle from '../lifecycles/[lifecycle]';

export default {
  name: 'lifecycles-plugin',
  hooks: {
+    lifecycle
  }
};
```

```diff
// gasket.js
import { makeGasket } from '@gasket/core';
+ import lifecyclesPlugin from './plugins/lifecycles-plugin.js';

export default makeGasket({
  plugins: [
+    lifecyclesPlugin
  ],
  filename: import.meta.filename,
});
```

Alternatively, you can hook the lifecycle directly in the plugin and then import
the plugin to `gasket.js`.

```diff
// /plugins/lifecycles-plugin.js

export default {
  name: 'lifecycles-plugin',
  hooks: {
+    lifecycle: async function(gasket) {
+      gasket.logger.info('Created lifecycle: ', lifecycle);
+    }
  }
};
```
