# @gasket/plugin-logger

This plugin adds a logger to your Gasket application and introduces lifecycles
for custom logger implementations. This plugin is included by default in all
Gasket applications.

At this time, there is only one plugin which implements a
custom logger: `@gasket/plugin-winston`.

## Lifecycles

### createLogger

To implement a custom logger, hook the `createLogger` lifecycle. Your hook,
which may be asynchronous, must return an object with this shape:

```typescript
type Logger = {
  [level: string]: (...args: Array<any>) => void,
  child: (metadata: Object) => Logger,
  close?: () => Promise<void> // Optional
}
```

The `level` keys are the log levels that your logger supports. The values are
functions that accept any number of arguments and write them to the log. Your
logger must support, at minimum, the following levels:

- `debug`
- `error`
- `info`
- `warn`

The `child` function is used to create a new logger with additional metadata.
The `metadata` argument is set of properties that will be included in every log
entry. The `child` function must return a new logger with the same shape as the
parent logger.

The `close` function, if supplied, is called when the application is shutting
down and should be used to close any open resources.

## Test
