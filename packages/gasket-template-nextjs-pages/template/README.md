# page-router-ts-proxy

Gasket App

## Overview

This application is built with [Gasket] and [Next.js] utilizing [EcmaScript Modules] and requires Node.js v20 or higher.

## Getting Started

### Development

To start the app locally, run:

```bash
cd page-router-ts-proxy
npm install
npm run local
```

### Debugging

To start the API locally with debugging enabled, run:

```bash
DEBUG=* npm run local
```

Extended filtering of the debug output can be achieved by adding to the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=gasket:* npm run local // gasket operations only
DEBUG=:* npm run local //  operations only
```

### Documentation

Generated docs will be placed in the `.docs` directory. To generate markdown documentation for the API, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

### Page Router

This Gasket app uses Next.js 14 with [Page Router] which relies on the traditional file-based routing within the pages directory. The integration with Next.js 14 leverages features like server-side rendering and static optimization, providing a streamlined development process and ensuring the app remains efficient and scalable.

### Development Proxy

The HTTPS proxy in this Gasket app forwards requests to the default Next.js server, enabling HTTPS for development and support on deployed servers.
### TypeScript & Page Router

When using TypeScript with Next.js and Gasket on the default Next.js server, the Page Router files also operate within a CommonJS (CJS) environment. This contrasts with Gasket's configuration, which is set to type: module for ES Modules (ESM), requiring careful handling to ensure compatibility between the two environments.

Additionally, Gasket files like gasket.ts, gasket-data.ts, intl.ts, and app-level plugins can all be written in TypeScript. This ensures type safety and better tooling support across the Gasket app, even when working within Next.jsâ€™s CJS environment.

#### ESM & TypeScript

A common workaround when using ESM in a TypeScript project with `"type": "module"` set in `package.json` is to import `.ts` files using the `.js` extension. For example:

```ts
import { myFunction } from './myModule.js';
```

Here, `myModule.ts` is the actual TypeScript file, but it's imported using the `.js` extension. TypeScript is able to resolve `myModule.ts` to `myModule.js`, making the import work at runtime.

For more information, see the extended documentation in the [Gasket TypeScript] doc and the [@gasket/plugin-typescript] package.


### Docusaurus

When using [Docusaurus], generated docs will be available at `http://localhost:3000` when running the [Docusaurus] server. By default the Docusaurus server is started with the `docs` script. Add the `--no-view` option to only generate the markdown files.
